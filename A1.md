## First Application: Be My Eyes
**Link to application:**  [https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/be-my-eyes-helping-the-blind/id905177575?mt=8](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/be-my-eyes-helping-the-blind/id905177575?mt=8)

**Description:** Be My Eyes is a native application which is based on free model and is available on both iOS and android platforms. The application uses device features such as torch, camera, GPS and API’s like Geolocation API. This application is basically designed for two categories of users, volunteers, blind and the visually impaired. The sighted people would sign up as volunteers and they will be receiving calls from the visually impaired to assist them with little things that would make their life easier and independent. These calls usually are live video calls and the user data (such as name, phone number etc.) of both users (volunteer and the visually impaired) would remain private. overall the application is novel, though there are applications like TapTapSee which aid the visually impaired, no application uses live video calling and actual people signing up as volunteers to do it. One thing I would like to see is appropriate follow up on issues that are raised through the application (especially issues concerned with video calling) or adding some FAQ’s for issues commonly associated to live video calling. [1]

**Technology Used:**

*	Accessibility features such as VoiceOver and
*	Screen Reader that uses synthetic speech which is used by the visually impaired to tell them what apps their fingers might be accessing. [4]



## First Heuristic Evaluation: Help and Documentation

The application has a great help and FAQ page for the sighted volunteers, from how to answer the calls to set up language preferences. Volunteers can also provide translations for their respective first language or any language they are familiar enough with. They can do so with the help of documentation (has a step by step procedure) that is available on the website of Be My Eyes as well as the app. In case users require further help they can send an e-mail, tweet or Facebook the be my eyes page. For the blind or visually impaired, the entire application can be accessed via the VoiceOver feature that is available on the iPhone. Though it has a great help page, the first time I received a call requiring assistance, the video on the other end was not visible and I was unable to help the user with his problem later, after the call ended the system prompted for feedback, I gave my feedback listing the video issues but unfortunately, I never understood what the actual issue was. A follow up on the issue or a FAQ (not only this issue but generalized issues that are often faced while live video calling) on this would have been helpful as the application itself revolves around live video calling.

## Second Heuristic Evaluation: Aesthetic and minimalist design
While using this app I observed that very little effort is needed from both the volunteer’s as well as the blind person’s end, the main purpose of this app is to connect a visually impaired person to a sighted volunteer for a simpler life and it does just that. First, from a volunteer’s perspective the purpose of this app is to help someone who needs it. Whenever someone requires help, a call would be directed to a volunteer for this to happen, the volunteer must have a working version of the application of their mobile phone with a working internet connection and nothing more. Second, from a blind person’s perspective whenever they require help all they must do is to open the app and touch anywhere on the screen and a call is placed to the available volunteer. By eliminating unnecessary steps to place or receive a call the application is very effective in terms of usage.
 
## Second Application: Duolingo

(https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/duolingo/id570060128?mt=8)

**Description:** Duolingo is a native application that uses freemium model and runs on both android and iOS platforms. Using this application, the users can learn any language for free most of the features that contribute to the learning part are for free yet, there are few sections of the application like taking a lesson offline or going ad free would require payment. When a language is selected a question is prompted by the system, asking for the language proficiency if it is for beginners it gets right into the language form basics and, if the user is not a beginner a test is conducted to assess the level of knowledge and the lessons are taken from there. There are multiple options to practice the language from, few of which are, learning simple words, names of animals, food, phrases, having conversations with bots and forming clubs with your friends to increase language proficiency. To motivate the users a daily goal is set, and points are given based on the achievements of the user. Along with this a user can choose the time limit they would want to spend on the application for a language. Daily remainders are sent via push notifications and e-mail to the users to complete their goals for the day. [2]

**Technology Used:**

*	Amazon web services
*	MySQL
*	Dynamo DB
*	Python
*	jQuery and
*	Twitter Bootstrap   [3]


        
## First Heuristic Evaluation: Match between system and real world
The application uses simple language and concepts that are easily understandable to the mundane users. It also uses teaching methods that are very similar to the real world which makes it easier for the user to understand which would mean that, less effort to understand the application functionalities and more effort towards to actual goal of learning the language. 
Few teaching methods and concepts that the application incorporates are as follows:
*	Identifying words or animals from pictures – has simple options to choose from like, words, animals phrases, food etc.
*	Practicing real conversations with bots (unlocks only after a certain level of fluency is reached) – is called the same on the app and a description explaining the same in simple words is given below
*	Creating clubs among friends where discussions can be initiated – can be initiated using the ‘create a club option’ or join an existing club using its code.
*	Testing your skills from time to time – can be accessed from ‘test your skills’ option on the application

## Second Heuristic Evaluation: Recognition rather than recall

All the options are visible on the home page of the application, the application is designed such that the user does not have to put in any kind of effort to remember information or move from one functionality to another. For example, the home page is divided into 3 parts – the first part contains four buttons. One, the course the user is currently in and if the user wishes to change between courses he can do that by clicking on the required course. Two, the goal information for the day. Three, fluency of the language (expressed in percentage). Four, the number of lingots (can be purchased via in-app purchases) these lingots can be used as virtual game currency. The second part contains the options via which one can learn the language – options like, words, phrases, etc. it also has test your skills option using which one can test their proficiency in the language. The third part contains options using which the user switch among pages such as the home page, bots (to practice real conversations), clubs and the shop where the user can make in app purchases.
